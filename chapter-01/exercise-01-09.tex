Assume that $s\,x = 3$, and determine $\B\eval{\neg(x = 1)}s$.\\

Ok, we have the following situation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\B\eval{(x = 1)}s = \ff$ because, using the third rule, we have that $\A\eval{x} = 1$ and $\A\eval{3} = 3$ and they are not equal.
	\item $\B\eval{\neg(x = 1)}s$ depends on the evaluation of $\B\eval{(x = 1)}s$ which is $\ff$, so, using the fifth rule, we obtain $\B\eval{\neg(x = 1)}s = \Tt$.
\end{itemize}
